            The urban development scenario simulator is a tool that estimates the expected environmental, social, and
            economic impacts of implementing public policies in urban development, mobility, and the environment. Its
            objective is to test various scenarios of urban expansion, population density, land use, public transport
            routes, creation of employment-attracting areas, as well as changes in water and energy consumption, and
            improvements in transport technologies; to demonstrate their benefits or implications through various
            metrics that contribute to decision-making and to raising awareness among the population about the impacts
            of cities, their dynamics and the possibilities to improve their sustainability.

            The Scenario Simulator is a web-based tool that helps stakeholders assess the municipality's plans. It uses
            a set of sustainability indicators to compare a city's current performance against different scenarios.
            These scenarios are created by combining several policy interventions, called policy levers.
            {% endblocktranslate %} <br>
            {% blocktranslate %}The simulator can facilitate the following activities:{% endblocktranslate %}

        <ul class="dashed">
            <li>{% blocktranslate %}Analyze current performance: Identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for
                improvement.{% endblocktranslate %}</li>
            <li>{% blocktranslate trimmed %}Test different scenarios: See how various combinations of policies (e.g.,
                infrastructure, regulations) impact sustainability in the future.
                {% endblocktranslate %}</li>
            <li>{% blocktranslate trimmed %}Make data-driven decisions: Choose the combination of policies that best
                advance toward sustainable development.{% endblocktranslate %}</li>

        The simulator is an IMPLANG initiative. Its main goal is to support consensus building and integrated planning
        to encourage the construction of a brighter and more sustainable future. <br>
        The simulator results from a joint effort between IMPLANG, the Mario Molina Center, CAPSUS, and UPTech.
